            <h1>Why bees are good</h1>

            <h3>Bee bread and honey</h3>
<p>Bees pollenate flowers while also making delicous bee bread and honey,without bees most of the earth would be as barren as mars,and most of the food we eat,clothing,and flowers would never exist.</p>
            <h3>Stingless bees</h3>
            <p>Most of the worlds bees are stingless and only bite,keeping their nests safe from ants with confusing burrows and they won't do you much harm,and most bees live underground away from you.</p>
            <h3>No bug spray</h3>
            <p>Bug spray kills every bug around,even helpful ones, and it can get into water streams causing terrible damage to the world and killing sea cretures, not to mention the littering of the cans.</p>
            <h6>So,all in all now you can see that bess are more than just stinging machines there many more points that I didn't cover that you can see on youtube.</h6>
